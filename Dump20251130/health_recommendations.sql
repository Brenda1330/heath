You must state the risk level and provide a direct action to mitigate it.\n\n**RULE:** 1. The output MUST start with \'Spike risk level:\' followed by \'Low\', \'Moderate\', or \'High\'. It should be framed as a forward-looking warning.\n\n2. Use the following ranges to determine the Spike Risk based on the CGM level (in mmol/L):\n   - < 4.0: High (due to rebound risk)\n   - 4.0 - 6.0: Low\n   - 6.1 - 7.8: Moderate\n   - 7.9 - 10.0: Moderate-High\n   - 10.1 - 13.9: High\n   - >= 14.0: Very High\n3. Your recommendation should align with the determined risk level.\n\n--- EXAMPLE ---\n**Patient Data:** CGM: 13.5 mmol/L (Risk: High)\n**Final Output:** Spike risk level: High. Your current glucose of 13.5 mmol/L and reduced activity indicate a high probability of continued high readings. It is crucial to reintroduce light activity, such as a 20-minute daily walk, to improve insulin sensitivity. Check with your clinician if readings remain above 15 mmol/L.\n--- END EXAMPLE ---\n\n--- YOUR TURN ---\n**Patient Data to Analyze:**\n- CGM Level: 12 mmol/L\n- Food Intake: Chicken Chop, Sprite\n- Activity Level: No Activity\n\nNow, provide only the **Final Output**, following all rules and the example format exactly.','Spike risk level: High. Your current glucose of 12 mmol/L, combined with high-carb food (Sprite) and no activity, indicates a high probability of future spikes. It is crucial to immediately take a 15-minute brisk walk to help process glucose and improve insulin sensitivity. Additionally, avoid further sugary drinks and hydrate with water. Monitor your CGM closely over the next few hours.','2025-11-28 15:59:19'),(54,1016,100169,'Gemini','PPR','You are a medical AI using a \'Personalized PageRank\' (PPR) insight. Your task is to compare a patient\'s data to successful patterns from similar patients.\n\n**Your Task:** Generate a detailed recommendation (60-80 words) that suggests specific diet and activity changes based on what worked for similar patients.\n\n**RULE:** Your output MUST:\n1. Start by stating the number of similar patient patterns found\n2. Suggest specific diet changes based on successful patterns\n3. Recommend specific activities that worked for others\n4.

To improve your CGM level, transition from Milo and Butter Cake to proven options like Oatmeal or Chicken Rice, which consistently supported better outcomes in similar cases. Maintain your current 30-minute walk, as this activity, or incorporating 30 minutes of jogging, significantly benefited others with similar profiles. These specific strategies are drawn directly from effective past patient journeys.','2025-11-28 15:59:31');
